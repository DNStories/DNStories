# Preliminary mid-year report 

# Is Big DNS Taking Over? A State of the Art Report

## Summary

This report presents research exploring the shift towards the consolidation of DNS services into a few large providers. The goal is to understand the extent of this consolidation, its implications, and the factors driving the trend.

### Key Findings:
- **Interviews with DNS stakeholders**: Conducted with representatives from various organizations, including ICANN, Internet Society, Quad9, and others, to gain insights into DNS trends.
- **Regulatory Landscape**: DNS resolver operators face regulatory challenges, including privacy concerns and compliance with global laws.
- **Open-source Software**: DNS operators generally express trust in open-source DNS software but note scalability challenges.
- **DNS Blocking**: Governments worldwide block DNS resolvers for censorship, affecting the global internet ecosystem.
- **Data Analysis**: A global decline in public DNS resolvers by ISPs was observed, with regional variations.

### Next Steps:
- Expand interviews to more network operators.
- Further analyze factors influencing DNS resolver adoption and provision.

## Introduction

The Domain Name System (DNS) is a core component of the internet. It translates human-readable domain names into machine-readable IP addresses. Over time, there’s been a trend of DNS consolidation into larger providers, referred to as "Big DNS."

The report addresses key questions:
1. Is there a trend towards using public DNS resolvers globally?
2. What factors drive the consolidation of DNS services?
3. What are the implications for internet users, businesses, and policymakers?

## Research Process and Methodology

### Organizations Interviewed:
- Public Interest Registry (PIR)
- Internet Society (ISOC)
- Quad9
- EasyDNS
- Comcast
- PowerDNS
- And more...

Each interview lasted 60-90 minutes, focusing on DNS adoption, open-source software, and regulatory challenges.

### Themes:
- **Regulatory Landscape**: Various legal requirements, such as data protection laws and content blocking, influence DNS providers.
- **Open-source Adoption**: Some DNS operators expressed trust in open-source DNS solutions, though large-scale operations face challenges.
- **DNS Resolver Blocking**: Highlighted instances of government-imposed DNS blocking.

## Data Analysis

The analysis focused on global trends in DNS resolver usage, using data from APNIC. Some key takeaways:
- **Global Decline in Public DNS Resolvers**: There’s been a decrease in public DNS resolver usage by ISPs, with significant regional variations.
- **Correlations**: No strong global correlation between internet freedom and DNS usage was found, but regional trends show variations.

### APNIC Data Insights:
- Western Europe: A weak positive correlation between the use of open resolvers and press freedom scores.
- Central Asia: A negative correlation, with lower press freedom correlating with higher usage of public resolvers.
